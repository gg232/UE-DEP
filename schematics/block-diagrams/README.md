Block diagrams are made with the free draw.io extension for Google Drive. Draw.io cannot simulate the diagram; it is a tool to assemble them from generic components.

In the system diagram, the *red* arrows are **5V power distribution**, the *green* arrows are **3V3 power distribution**, the *blue* arrows are **1V5 power distribution** and the *black* arrows are **signal paths**. (In this diagram, controls are treated as digital signals.)
